Radxport private limited has been incorporated with the objective of exploring mineral deposits, marketing of minerals and trading. The company has acquired granite quarries in Andhra Pradesh. Radxport has various clearance from the Government to execute the leases. With increasing demand for minerals in India and abroad. Major investments of the company is granite the widest range of products like black Galaxy and white Galaxy, Tan brown granite has enabled the company to compete in the current market and to lead as the pioneers of this area.

The company is managed by Mr. Hazarathaiah Jadapalli. He has more than two decades of experience in the mining industry. He successfully launched his ventures by grabbing new trading assignments from different countries. He started his career as trading consultant and executed several assignments on behalf of his firm as well as outsourced projects as an agency.

## The Mining Process

Dimension stone is the collective description of natural stone, which has been extracted from
the earth in an orderly manner, further worked by cutting and processing, then used in various building activities either structurally or for decorative purposes. It includes panels and tiles from
marble, granite, slate, sandstone basalt and other related materials.

The successful and economical working of granite quarries depends upon an intelligent
application of knowledge of the structure of the rock and its natural divisions in the mass, as well
as upon improved methods, tools, and machinery for quarrying. The topographical location of
the quarry and its relation to facilities for transportation are important factors that affect the productiveness and greatly modify the actual cost of operations in a given place.

The manufacturing process of granite blocks involves the following operations:

* Quarry opening; 
* Wire sawing; 
* blasting; 
* cutting;
* Dressing.

Quarrying for dimension stone requires a specialized method of extraction. Normal quarrying methods use large quantities of explosives to move huge volumes for breaking down into aggregate. This creates cracking throughout the stone, which renders it unsuitable for our purpose. Many a dimension stone quarry has been rendered useless by the over use of explosives.

Wire sawing is used for primary block extraction. The system consists of a long stranded wire or diamond tipped wire fed through a series of pulleys and assisted by abrasives. Stranded wire has been used for many years in marble and sandstone, whilst improvements in diamond technology, has seen the recent introduction of wire sawing in granite quarries. The yield from wire sawing is much higher and gives a semi finished surface which allows a close examination of the material before further working.

Cutting is performed by a gang-saw for producing granite slabs. Gang sawing uses a
reciprocating frame with up to 120 steel blades working their way through the block. It can take up to one week to saw each block. Granite cutting has no adverse impacts on the environment.

* Gang block cutting machine
* Slide cutting machine 
* Trolley type cutting machine 
* Polishing machine, pneumatic 
* Polishing machine, hand operated 
* Auto polisher, twin head 
* Quarry equipment Set
* Tools Set
* Mining equipment Set
* Auxiliary equipment

Radxport is not into polishing activities. The company intends to sell the unfinished blocks to its clients.

## Shipping

Radxport’s quarries are close to the port of Krishnapatnam Port (KPCL), Nellore District of Andhra Pradesh, India. The company has logistic competence from the quarry to the ship. It covers container stuffing and reliable partnerships regarding inland haulage, forwarding and shipping. Radxport can offer our customers the most convenient way of shipping blocks to the destination ports around the world.

### Single origin

The granite is found within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single quarry or a specific collection of quarries from one geographic area. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Shade-grown coffee

Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest under-story in its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

### Sustainable mining

Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing

Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits

We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
